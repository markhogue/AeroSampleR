Title: Estimate aerosol particle collection through sample lines
Version: 0.1.11
Author: Mark Hogue
Maintainer: Mark Hogue <mark.hogue@srs.gov>
Description: Estimate ideal efficiencies of aerosol sampling through sample
    lines. For simplicity and verification purposes, baseline efficiency 
    functions will be based on DEPOSITION CALCULATOR TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION 
    MANUAL, BC-15-RP-003, Version 1.1.1 available from 
    http://www.bluntconsulting.com/pdf/depo-calc-tech-desc-v111.pdf. This
    code has been verified at SRS with Q-CLC-G-00128, R0, DEPOSITION 
    CALCULATOR software validation. From this base, the package will be 
    broadened as needed for additional models, with the driving original 
    intent of covering alternative bend models.
